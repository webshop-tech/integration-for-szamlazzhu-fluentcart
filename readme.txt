= Important Warnings =

**Before using this plugin in production:**

1. **Enable Test Mode** in both FluentCart and Számlázz.hu
2. **Generate test invoices** to verify everything works correctly
3. **Consult with your accountant** to ensure the plugin meets your accounting requirements
4. **Review all generated invoices** for accuracy
5. **Test all edge cases** relevant to your business

**This plugin generates official accounting documents. Incorrect invoices can have legal and tax implications.**

= API Usage Costs =

**Számlázz.hu charges for API usage.** This plugin uses the Számlázz.hu Agent API to generate invoices automatically, which is a paid service. Review the [Számlázz.hu pricing](https://www.szamlazz.hu/egyedi-megoldasok/tomeges-szamlageneralas/) before enabling automatic invoice generation.

= Limitations =

* **VAT Rates**: Only explicit rates supported (0%, 5%, 18%, 27%). Named VAT keys (AAM, TAM, TEHK) are not supported.
* **B2B Sales**: Buyers must have an EU VAT ID. Local VAT ID only is not yet supported.
* **Document Types**: Only Invoices can be generated. Receipts and Pro forma invoices are not supported.
* **IPN**: Instant Payment Notification is not yet supported.
* **Lag**: Customers might need to wait a few seconds on the order conrifmation page before being able to download the invoice.
* **Shipping VAT**: FluentCart shipping VAT may contain **minor rounding errors**. This is a known bug in FluentCart, which will be corrected in the following releases. The shipping VAT on the **invoice is calculated correctly** according to Hungarian legal regulations. This may cause a small difference (fraction of a Forint) between what the customer pays, and what appears on the invoice.

* English (Default)
* Hungarian (Magyar)

The interface language follows your WordPress language settings.
